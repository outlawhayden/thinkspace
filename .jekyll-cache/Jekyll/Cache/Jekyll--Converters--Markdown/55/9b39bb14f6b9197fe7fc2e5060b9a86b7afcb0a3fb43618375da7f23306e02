I"Q<p>Hi – I’m Hayden Outlaw, (it’s my real name), and I’m a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, USA. I’m a big fan of photography, computers, dogs, and people, and like thinking about how we can bring them together.</p>

<p>Want to reach out? Have something cool to show me or talk about? Shoot me an email at <strong><em>haydenkoutlaw [at] gmail [dot com]</em></strong>. Bots, scrapers, and recruiters should go do something else.</p>
