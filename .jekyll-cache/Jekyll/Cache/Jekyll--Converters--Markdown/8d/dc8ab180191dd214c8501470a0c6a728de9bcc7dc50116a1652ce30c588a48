I"æ<p>Hi â€“ Iâ€™m Hayden Outlaw, (itâ€™s my real name), and Iâ€™m a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, USA. Iâ€™m a big fan of photography, computers, dogs, and people, and like thinking about how we can bring them together.</p>

<p>Want to reach out? Have something cool to show me or talk about? Shoot me an email at <strong><em>haydenkoutlaw [at] gmail [dot com]</em></strong>. Bots, scrapers, and recruiters should go do something else.</p>
