Hi -- I'm Hayden Outlaw, (it's my real name), and I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at North Carolina State University. I'm a big fan of math, computers, people, and like thinking about how we can bring them together. I got my Bachelor's in Math and CS at Tulane University in 2024, and before that I lived in Boulder, CO. 

Want to reach out? Have something cool to show me or talk about? I'm always happy to chat! Shoot me an email at ***haydenkoutlaw \[at\] gmail \[dot com\]***. *For professional inquiries, please reach out through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayden-outlaw/) or via NCSU. Bots, scrapers, and recruiters should go do something else.* Thanks!
